# Overview

This is a collection of script and config files that set up my remote and local development environments.

# Usage

Make sure you are either in the `cloud` or `local` directories, then run the `<cloud|local>_setup.sh` file. This will install the environment's respective packages and configurations.

When making additions to the scripts/config files, consider whether the changes belong in the `cloud`, `local`, or `shared` (used in both environments) directories.
